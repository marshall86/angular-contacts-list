# Angular Material Contacts List

This is a simple project with Angular Material.
The website will show an home page with a static content, the contacts list and the contact details with a dynamic form.

The contacts list is in the contacts.json file in the src folder.

For this project I used json-server as a mock REST api so before starting the project with npm start or ng serve is recommended to start the server with npm start json:server

Some unit tests are implemented.

Todo:

Understand how to add a new address with the mock api, I didn't manage unfortunately
Integrate NGRX

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
